# babylongjs-exploration



NOTE:  delete this from the final readme:

Post on medium.com

1.  post a link to my github
2.  link to my linkedin
3.  link to Iron Yard?

Critical path:

Phase 1:  do the tutorial as written (typing in each statement not cut/paste)
1.  create repo and init local repository
2.  follow tutorial and use CDN for babylonjs?  
3.  pick one or two spots to step throught the code in the browser inspector...what the "gaming environment in the browser looks like" and include a screenshot with some interesting bits
(some other stuff to do here?)
10.  Final step:  commit to github the "es5 tutorial"


Phase 2 convert project to es6/The Iron Yard coding standards
1.  npm install babylonjs? vs. using CDN?
2.  replace "var" keyword with "let"
3.  move javascript statements embedded in browser into seperate js file inside IIFE
4.  validate operation and commit to github


Phase 3:  Add a few features/changes to the scene
Such as:
1.  change the color of the ball in the scene
2.  add another ball that circles around the first
3.  dim out the scene (or whiteout)
